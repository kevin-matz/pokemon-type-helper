## Features
- Input type combination to get a list of effectivities against it
- Search Pokémon by their english or german names to automatically select their type(s)
- Switch the game's generation to reflect the correct effectivity calculation, list of Pokémon and their respective typings at that point in time, e.g.
  - *Psychic* type was nerfed in the 2nd generation as it was weak to *Ghost* instead of being immune to it then
  - *Rotom* alternative forms changed typings from 5th generation
  - Introduction of the *Fairy* type with the 6th generation changed multiple Pokémon's typings
- Responsive user interface that should also work on mobile phones
